\usage{
theme_journal_core(
  base_size = 11,
  base_family = NULL,
  grid_major_y = TRUE,
  grid_major_x = FALSE,
  grid_minor = FALSE,
  panel_border = TRUE,
  strip_border = TRUE,
  axis_ticks_inside = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_size}{Numeric base text size passed to \code{ggplot2::theme_minimal()}.
Defaults to 11. This does not change sizes you have already set explicitly.}

\item{base_family}{Optional base font family. Leave \code{NULL} to inherit.}

\item{grid_major_y, grid_major_x}{Logical; draw major grids on Y / X?}

\item{grid_minor}{Logical; draw minor grids?}

\item{panel_border}{Logical; draw a thin black panel border?}

\item{strip_border}{Logical; draw a thin border around facet strips?}

\item{axis_ticks_inside}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} ticks point inward.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2::theme} object.
}
\description{
A small, conservative theme scaffold tuned for old-fashioned journals:
clear axes, restrained grids, and white backgrounds. It avoids touching
text sizes—only layout, lines, and colors—so it plays nicely with your
own font helpers.

\examples{
if (requireNamespace("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
  library(ggplot2)
  p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point()
